Q: Is there any environmental constraints for accessing the program?
A: Because we will not access the source code of the game, so we cannot create anything new,
we will use the python library that client provided to make some interesting lessons.


Q: Will you be automating any part of the testing process?
A: We will not use any automation tools for testing, we will use python library that client provided and test the code in the game manually.

Q: How much experience with programming and AI is expected of the teachers and students using the program?
A: Teachers and students don’t need any AI experience, but they should know the basics of Python e.g. define a function, using for loop…

Q: Could you maybe explain more of what the UI for students will look like?
A: The UI should look like a Jupyter Notebook now. 
Some cells in the notebook will teach the AI knowledge and some cells are for coding, the UI will display in a window in the game. 

Q: Who are the creators of the lesson plans and are they a user group? Do teachers have to create the lesson plan and tasks themselves?
A: We will create the lesson plan and make a lesson. 
Teachers will be able to check the lessons in the lesson library then they can choose a lesson they want to use for teaching.

Q: How does Minecraft help this project to improve the quality of teaching?
A: In the game students will use python code to control their agent to finish some tasks.
Minecraft would make students more engaged in programming instead of seeing it as a boring task.
