Our project is a web-based app that is used to teach high school students AI and Python. We are planning to provide three lessons on the website to help students learn how to code in the  Minecraft Education Edition. In Minecraft Education, an agent will act like a robot that players can program to aid them in their survival world. There is one lesson delivered and a quick-start page to help users finish the environment set-up in the first peer testing. 
	The quick-start page was designed to help users set their environment to meet every requirement to finish the lesson. It includes game downloading, Python installation, and a link to the official helping center.
	The first lesson is called Gold Miner. It is used to teach students how to write a basic algorithm, enabling the agent to mine the gold blocks automatically. We used a code editor, a demo video and 4 tasks to help users get familiar with Python and the game. More details are presented below.
