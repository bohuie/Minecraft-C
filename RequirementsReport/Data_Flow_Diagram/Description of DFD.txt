Description of Data Flow Diagram

DFD level 0


briefly shown the data flow in the game

1.Player (Student) can login to the game and choose a lesson they are interested in, then the game will show the tasks using jupyter notebook format. 

2.Teachers will basically do the same thing as a student, they can login to the game and check the content of the lesson, and decide which lesson they want to use to teach their students.



DFD level 1


Player can choose a world in the game (different map)

Players can access the lesson library on our website. They can browse all lessons in the lesson library and choose a lesson they would like to learn.

Each lesson is actually a jupyter notebook hosted on the website. When users select a lesson in the lesson library, they can access the notebook and get tasks and tutorials.

Users can follow the tutorial and use python language as input to control their agent and finish tasks.

We will use a websocket to keep the communication between notebook and game, the python code will be converted to game command and sent to game. And game will run the command and show the change to players.

This data flow diagram shows the data flow between the whole system, but Minecraft is a fully developed system, and most of the functionality shown above are already developed.
In this project our goal is to use the python library that client provided, to develop more lessons which will teach students some AI knowledge.
Therefore, we only develop the website and some lessons, and we will use those processes to test our lesson in the game.
(For Peer test #1 we will have a basic website that allow user signin and choose lessons, and for Peer test #2 We will have a fully developed website and some lessons.
In final deliverable we will deliver more different lessons about AI knowledge)
