What is the "Learn AI" or "Learn ML" ARC? How do you introduce AI to kid and create a learning progression to being an AI expert?

Start with a problem, and explain how it can be solved with AI/ML. Introduce very basic concepts and ideas, and build them up.


Ai is a big area, what area are you going to focus on?
Computer Vision and Natural Language Processing


Where you are going to focus in the learning arc? (elementary, middle or high school)
High school


What is the sample curriculum that teaches the concept?
Hopefully the provided textbook, if not we will begin to teach ourselves the concepts. (Nick is currently in a CV class, and will be taking AI in January). Additionally, we have found some kaggle and code academy documents.


What features do you need in the platform that enable you to teach these lessons? Examples: data collecting, data visualization, etc.


Data collection, coding the robot, some way to verify the inputs.
