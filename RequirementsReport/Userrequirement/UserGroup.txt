Teachers (primary):


Our project is trying to provide a set of lessons for instructors who are 
trying to teach their students AI and ML. Based on students of different ages, 
there are appropriate curriculums for them. Teaching students coding for a game 
object is much more interesting and acceptable to understand abstract AI concepts 
than just let them do assignments or labs given by textbooks. 



High School Students (primary):


In this group, students are able to accept some basic concepts of AI. They have 
the ability to understand how simple codes work and explore how to design algorithms. 
They will directly use Python to code a robot agent during the lessons. Those created
 codes will be transferred into Minecraft Education Edition where codes will be tested 
on an in-game robot. After finishing all lessons, students will obtain a self-designed 
robot agent with some abilities such as defending villages, killing mobs or auto-mining. 
Meanwhile, they are able to explore more features on the robot on their own.



People interested in AI (Secondary):


For anyone interested in AI concepts, our project can be an easy start as a preparation 
for further learning. These users can practice coding and designing during the using. 



IT Tech Department (Secondary):


They are the maintainers for this website. They receive reports of system status and 
respond to arising issues. They also need to update the database and develop new features.
