Lesson 2 – Ideas 
1. Non linear regression 
I think that would be a good idea because it follows Andy’s lesson on linear regression. 
I’d like to re-use Andy’s chicken idea so the students are familiar with the concept and clearly understand the difference between linear and non linear regression. 
However, I will have to learn more about it myself to make sure we can do that (which is most of what I did this week).

2. Using pytorch for ML 
I think learning to use a library and starting to see real things happen can be a really cool lesson too. The pro of going that route is to offer a variety of things within our 3 lessons delivered as our final report. In could be another way to go instead of doing the first 3 lesson of a machine learning course. I like this idea because it gives the user a better idea of using ML with just 3 lessons but it might be better to have a logical continuation (opinions are welcome!!!). 

Using pytorch lesson would include:
Tensors 2D and 3D
Loading and manipulating datasets
Prediction Linear degression with pytorch 
Training linear regression with pytorch

Going deeper from learning what linear regression is in the first lesson
Also spent some time this week learning about this librairy, ressources:
