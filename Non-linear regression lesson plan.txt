Quantitative Scores
The graph below 
indicates the average score given by the eight participants on the thirteen 
questions that were asked to them. A score of five indicates that the participant strongly 
agreed with a statement when a score of 1 indicates that the participants strongly disagreed with a statement.
From this evaluation we can notice 2 main issues:


The participants do not feel ready to apply those machine learning concepts on their own just by using those lessons.
It can be hard to jump into those machine learning and AI concepts because it requires a lot of prior knowledge. 
One of our participants noted “The only thing that wasn't fluid was the fact that 
I didn't know python so I sort of got stuck when I had the task of writing the functions and stuff”.  
Although teaching all the prerequisites is out of scope for our project it would be 
good to have a list of concepts required to be able to advance to a certain lesson. 
The Minecraft Education Edition library contains other computer science lessons like learning Python 
(which would have helped that participant) so directing the student to those lessons first will make sure they have 
the skills to advance to this lesson. 

Sometimes the participants are unsure of what they need to accomplish. 	
Participants noted things like, lessons do not give “instructions to every step: what you want the user to do”, 
“People who have never played Minecraft probably do not know shortcuts in the game” or 
“The instructions in the course are not clear enough”. Having more detailed instructions should definitely be a priority. 
This could include things like more code samples, 
explaining the code line by line or making sure that the user always knows what to click next.
