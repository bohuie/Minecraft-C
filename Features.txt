CV: The player can find some pictures in the game and label them(monster and ores), then use the picture to train the model. 
If the label is wrong the robot will attack the villagers or ignore the monster. After the training the robot can act as guard and protect the village.
Enchant weapon: There could be some elemental monster or Boss monster during the adventure, 
and players can enchant their weapons to attack monsters more effectively. (enchant can be done by some simple programming games)

Next level: Players can complete the game by finding some Ancient Slates in Minecraft world and decipher 
the information on the slate (can be some programming game). Once they decipher all information, they can get a key and go to the next level of the game.

Explore the world: There are some Ancient ruins in Minecraft world and player can explore the ruins and get some information about the Ancient Slates (some programming knowledges)

A game should have a Rational and continuous story, for example a NPC would have some tasks for the player, and when the player finished the task, NPC can give some rewards to the player, for example some useful information or some weapons.
