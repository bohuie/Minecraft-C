1 - Hello everyone, weâ€™re Group C for the Minecraft Education project. Our team members are (read of names and titles)

2 - Our project goal is to teach middle school students Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning topics through Minecraft Education. Students will use AI and ML, along with Python, to interact with and manipulate the Minecraft world around them.

3 - Our client is Microsft and Mojang Studios. Currently, we are working with the client to create a learning arc between the three groups, so the groups' lessons works like one cohesive course. Additionally, we are continuing to brainstorm ideas about how we can teach AI and ML topics to middle schoolers.

4 - What is Minecraft Education? Minecraft Education is built upon the popular video game Minecraft. It takes the gameplay of Minecraft, but transforms it into a teaching tool. Students can run lessons in a variety of topics, from arts and history, to mathematics and computer science. Typically, students can build, mine, and craft in Minecraft, but with Minecraft Education they can now also code.

5 (Tech Stack) - Our Tech Stack will mostly include Python and JSON, and possibly C++ if we get access to the source code. Students will complete their lessons with Python. To create lessons, we will use Everglade, which is an add-on to Minecraft Education's Codebuilder. Everglade lessons can be created with a JSON file and a Jupyter Notebook file.

6 - Here is an ingame example of Everglade. At the top you can see the lesson sections, in the middle you can see the actual lessons, and below you can see the editor where the students can edit and run code.
