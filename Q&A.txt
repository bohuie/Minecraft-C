Shouldn't there me more people testing it during functional testing than just 3 people?
How much knowledge do the teachers need to implement this in their lesson plans? What format will your mock-ups take? (are they in Minecraft, diagrams, text descriptions?)
would new lessons be able to be created? or would a complete set of them be finished by the end of development?
Why did you choose to focus on the middle school group? - Is the final deliverable a prototype?
What kind of Minecraft scenario would students use AI/ML in?
How would a process of constructing a streamlined course from elementary to high school work?
why is security important for non functional requirement?
Will your team have to learn AI to teach it? Will they also have to learn how to teach to younger user groups?
Will your team be using C++ directly?
How do planned features leverage minecraft to increase learning
How does Minecraft help this project to improve the quality of teaching?
Is this a free program? What consists of lessons? What age group is this program for, in the introduction you guys say middle school, then in the "user groups" slide it says elementary school?
Each minecraft group seems to have a different understanding of the intended demographic. Elementary-Highschool has been referred to. Is each group working for different ages?
Did you guys have choice of program stack or was it provided by Mojang / Microsoft?
Will you be conducting any heuristic evaluations to gain teacher and student feedback? Will the game be able to operate under poor internet and/or old technology (some rural schools may not have fast speed internet or updated technology)?
In the presentation you mention that the Final Project will be a High Fidelity prototype. Does this mean that you won't be creating the final product but rather a prototype of the final product? You mentioned not allowing anyone to attack anyone else. Are there any other restrictions you are going to place on the users (i.e. chat monitoring, making sure blocks aren't placed in an inappropriate way, ect.)?
Will there be potential to create custom lessons outside the lesson library?
For your testing strategy you didn't mention using any of the github workflows in your continuous intergration is that something your group is planning to use in their testing strategy? What is the plan when it comes to linters? Will the use of a PEP8 linter be used?
Will you be creating and writing lessons yourselves, or simply implementing the interface and software for presenting these lessons? What tools do you plan to use to create your low-fidelity prototypes and early mockups?
How do you guys ensure the security of the program? Any tools used to make sure the continuous integration?
Are you having middle school students program computer vision all within minecraft? Or is it more so covering the topics? If it is the former that seems like a tough one to teach people who don't have years of coding experience.
Will you be building executable (.exe) files using python or just sticking to .json files? Also, for your user group, will you be implementing differently for younger students as compared to younger adults (hs students). Will it be more complex for the older target groups?
Will you have end users (students) test the program?
Will there be resources for the teacher who wants to introduce their students to AI, but do not have a background in programming themselves?
Your milestones don't refer to any coding until the final milestone. Is there a reason that the code has to be left so late?
Who are the creators of the lesson plans and are they a user group? do teachers have to create the lesson plan and tasks themselves?
 when exactly will you begin coding this project? after peer 1 or peer 2?
If I understand correctly, development will not start until the final milestone. Will that be enough time to finish the system?
 It seems unrealistic to do all the coding between milestone 2 and 3 (approximately 1- 1.5 months). What efforts have you taken to scope and schedule your project in order to assure your client that this timeline can be met? This seems like an enormous amount of work to leave to the end.
1.Why is the minecraft education slide all caps? 2. Are you missing a user group? What about the children's parents if they want to keep track of their children's progress? This was unclear. 3. What does NPC mean? (in non-func slides) 4. How do you plan on dealing with children's data? how are you making sure this is kept safe?
 What is the learning arc between the three school groups?
