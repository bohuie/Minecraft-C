Milestone description: In this milestone we will primarily focus on the environment of the lesson. The deliverable in peer test 1 is a lesson prototype based on Minecraft platform. 
In this prototype, User should be able to load our lesson in Minecraft Education (Map and lesson tasks), and they should be able to communicate with Non-player characters (NPC) and get a simple task. 
Users should be able to write and run python code in the build-in code editor. Due to the time constraint, we can only finish a part of the linear regression scenario. In this part we will teach users some basic knowledge of linear regression.
