Environmental constraints




Time limitation:




Because our group reoriented the first milestones to build a website outside the game, 
we don’t have too much time left to finish coding. In the next three weeks, 
we need to create a website that contains our lessons, a database for users to store their 
data and test the connection between web and Minecraft.  



Communication limitation:


Due to Covid-19, our way to communication was limited. Only remote meetings are 
available and most of the discussion will be done through Discord. We are also 
facing a problem that group members are in different time zones which means we 
need to consider more for meetings to find a time that fits everyone’s work and rest.



Source-code limitation:




We do not have access to the source code of Minecraft Education Edition. Therefore, 
we can not directly write codes of any in-game features. We will use Electron to 
transfer code from the website into the game. It may lead to many issues when we 
are trying to debug the codes from the website.
