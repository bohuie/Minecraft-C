Currently, the tech stack is limited to what is compatible with Minecraft Education. This means that the primary languages used will be C++, Python, and JSON. The students will use Python in their lessons to learn AI/ML concepts. To create the lessons in Minecraft Education, we will use Everglade: an add-on to Minecraft Educationâ€™s Codebuilder used to teach Python. Lessons will be created with a JSON file and a Jupyter Notebook file.

Consider: Tensorflow/Pytorch/Keras; or Azure/Google Cloud/AWS?
