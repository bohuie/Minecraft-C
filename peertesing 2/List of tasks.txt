User group:

High school students:
The high school student who wants to learn Python and AI by Minecraft Education. 
We assume that our users have some basic Python programming skills, such as defining a variable, 
using  loops and functions. The users will learn the theory and how to use Python to implement AI and ML algorithms in our lessons.

Teachers:
The teacher who wants to use a novel and engaging way to teach the concepts of AI and ML. 
They will run our courses as students and decide whether to use them in their teaching.
