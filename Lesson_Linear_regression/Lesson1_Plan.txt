Background:

There is a village that needs to build a chicken farm. There are now 87 chickens in the village, 
but no one knows how big the farm should be. You are the builder of this chicken farm, 
and you need to use your robot to build a proper chicken farm for the village. 
The farm should not be too large (villagers do not want to waste money) or too small 
(because it will affect the growth of the chickens). Therefore, you need to find a proper size by your self.
Here are some data from other chicken farms, please use this data to predict the size of this farm and 
help the villagers to build it.


Sample Data:

Farm size: [20,40,60,80,100,120,140,40,50,60,105,48,54,63,72,103,108,93,90,68,36,90,88]

N of Chickens: [15,28,50,68,75,93,130,35,38,78,81,33,40,45,75,70,100,95,60,70,70,110,52]


Student Objectives:

Use Python to find the line that best fits the sample data.

Use your own model to predict the farm size for 87 chickens.

Use your agent to help the villager to build a chicken farm with proper size.



What is Classification:

Classification is the process of finding or discovering a model or function which helps in separating
the data into multiple categorical classes. For example, classify if an email is spam or not. (the output is discrete value)


What is Regression:

Regression is the process of finding a model or function for distinguishing the data
into continuous real values instead of using classes or discrete values. For example, we have a dataset
that contains some data on the price of a house vs. the size of a house. 
Then we can predict the price of a new house based on the size. (the output is continuous)

Linear regression:
This is one of the simplest Machine Learning model. We can use it to find the line that best fits the data.
