Lesson Goal:

•	Learn the idea of Classification (Unsupervised and Supervised learning).

•	Learn how to use pandas to read a csv dataset.

•	Learn how to use python matplotlib library to print and analyse data.

•	Learn how to calculate the distance between vectors (points)

•	Learn Normalization

•	Implement K-nearest neighbors by python.

•	Learn how to use Python Skit-learn Library to perform KNN.


Background:

Emeralds are very popular commodities among the villagers, so you decide to collect them through mining. 
However, your robot can only mine one mine due to fuel problems, and you don’t know what ore is in each mine. 
In this world, different kinds of ore will affect the growth of plants on the ground, so if you can find patterns in that,
You can predict what ore is going to be in each mine. you could use your agent to collect plants from the mine and use the 
data the company has collected to predict what ore the mine contains. Here’s some data collected by some miners. 
Let’s use it to predict which mine has emeralds!


Data: 

Total 220 lines 9:1->train:val

training set: 198 lines

validation set: 22 lines.

Some examples:

Oxeye_daisy   allium   blue_orchid   red_tulip   label

    5            9           10          7         0
  
    11           3           4           10        1
    
    10           5           3           11        1

    4            8           10          7         0

...........


 
Label 1= Emeralds                  Label 0= iron ore



Data to predict: Students will collect the data in the game and use the model to predict the value


Student Objectives:

Use python to build a KNN classification model. 

Use your own model to predict which mine have emeralds.
