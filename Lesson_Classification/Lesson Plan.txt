•	Learn how to use Python Skit-learn Library to perform KNN.


Background:

Emeralds are very popular commodities among the villagers, so you decide to collect them through mining. 
However, your robot can only mine one mine due to fuel problems, and you don’t know what ore is in each mine. 
In this world, different kinds of ore will affect the growth of plants on the ground, so if you can find patterns in that,
You can predict what ore is going to be in each mine. you could use your agent to collect plants from the mine and use the 
data the company has collected to predict what ore the mine contains. Here’s some data collected by some miners. 
Let’s use it to predict which mine has emeralds!


Data: 

Total 220 lines 9:1->train:val

training set: 198 lines

validation set: 22 lines.

Some examples:

Oxeye_daisy   allium   blue_orchid   red_tulip   label

    5            9           10          7         0
  
    11           3           4           10        1
    
    10           5           3           11        1

    4            8           10          7         0

...........


 
Label 1= Emeralds                  Label 0= iron ore



Data to predict: Students will collect the data in the game and use the model to predict the value


Student Objectives:

Use python to build a KNN classification model. 

Use your own model to predict which mine have emeralds.




The difference between supervised learning and unsupervised learning:


In supervised learning, we use a set of labeled data to train our model.
For example, in a classification task, if we want our model to be able to distinguish between dogs and cats in a 
set of photos, we can use a set of images and label them with cat or dog. After the training use this data,
our model will be able to identify the new image and label it as a cat or a dog.

In unsupervised learning, we use unlabeled data to train the model. The model will analyze the data and find
patterns in it. For example, if we train a model by a set of pictures of cat and dog, but without any labels,
the model could divide photos into two categories and if we provide a new image of cat,
the model will put the picture in the same category as the cat.
