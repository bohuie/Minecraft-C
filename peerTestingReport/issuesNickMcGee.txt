Issue: User gets confused with the ‘read only’ code area.
Severity: 2 (Causes slight confusion, doesn’t break the system)
Violation: Aesthetic design and Visibility
Description: When the user first enters the code editor, there is a built in demo area. This should be removed, as users often thought this was where they are meant to code.
Modification: Remove this read only area, as it is not needed.

Issue: Users felt the need for a reset button.
Severity: 2 (Can break the lesson if the world is not reset. This would be a 3, but may not be needed in final product)
Violation: Help users recover from errors.
Description: When the Agent mines away at the mining area, it does not regenerate. If the user incorrectly mines the area, they are unable to reset it back to how it was.
Modification: Using an in-game command block, we would be able to reset the mining area.

Issue: Users were frustrated that they couldn’t copy and paste code in the in-game code editor.
Severity: 2 (Users are still able to continue with the lesson, but a bit of nuisance)
Violation: User control and freedom.
Description: Users cannot copy from the in-game code editor. This is frustrating if they want to move some code around, or reuse pieces of code. Pasting from outside sources still works.
Modification: See if we can add in a copy function to the in-game code editor. This may be dependent on the client adding it in.
