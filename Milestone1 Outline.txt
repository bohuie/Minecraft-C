Introduction (describe the project), Users and user requirements (functional and non-functional), Usability goals, User experience goals, Design principles, Usability scenarios, Project non-functional requirements and environmental constrains, Tech stack possibilities (not yet determine but we will outline the pros and cons of each), Draft of our ideas (pros and cons of each) + draft of lesson plan and how they relate to the game, Timeline (list of functional requirements for each): , Peet testing 1: Research report
Peer testing 2: Low fidelity prototype
Final project: High fidelity prototype
Testing
Low fidelity: Heuristic evaluation to evaluate the low fidelity prototype (get feedback from other teams using the heuristic evaluation form for COSC 341, get that feedback from Jeff on other people on the Minecraft team).
          	High fidelity: Unit testing (mock outgoing calls, such as calls to the user’s data), functional tests (get people to play the game and detect issues with our prototype)
List of questions raised by students.
