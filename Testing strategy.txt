Testing strategy

Tools:

1. Electron App (client provided for testing)
2. GitHub for Integration testing

Unit Testing

1. Our lesson will have a notebook-like user interface (like Jupyter notebook), and each cell in the notebook is a smallest unit in our project.
When we design a small part of a lesson (an unit), we should test the unit in the Minecraft code builder (a built-in code editor in the Minecraft Education)
to see if the game can run our code properly.

2. We may need to change or add some functions in the built-in python code in the game, each time when we have some changes,
we should test the function and related functions in the code editor to make sure that change will not crash the game. 


Peer Functional Testing

1. When a  feature is implemented, we should include a list of functionalities (associated with the feature) in the pull request. 
When code is merged, other 3 group members should pull the code and test in game to see if the functionalities are all working as described in the pull request.

2. If anyone needs to change the built-in python code in the game,
everyone in the group should pull the new code to test if the change has any conflict with their own works.


Integration Testing and Regression Testing

1. Everyone should perform an integration test for every five small units. This test should be done manually in the code builder.

2. Github will be used for continuous integration. (when each lesson is done, every member should pull the whole lesson and test for bug and functionality)
 
3. Regression testing should be performed manually. Each time we merge our code, 
we should rerun the whole lesson in the game and check if the new code conflicts with the old one or generate a new bug.


About automation testing

1. We will not use any automation test tool in our project since we will use a built-in python library in the game.
Itâ€™s easier to run our code in the game directly and test for bug and functionality
