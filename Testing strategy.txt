Testing strategy
1. Unit testing
Every feature should have its associated unit tests (test-driven development) 
Part of the acceptance criteria for each PR
Not every piece of code is unit testable if the code the group member is working on does not allow for unit test that person should explain in their PR why they cannot provide unit tests
2. Functional testing
Each PR should have a list of functionalities (associated with the feature)
When code is merged the 3 group members that did not code the feature should pull the code and test if the functionalities are all working as described in the PR. 
If something is not working the way intended the testers should issue a bug.
3. Performance testing 
Starts 2 weeks before each milestone (likely to only be for final milestone) 
Record metrics like time to complete certain task, loading time and such. 
Game can be complex and have a heavy back end but if performance are bad the user won’t want to play we should ensure good performance.
