AI and ML are based on computer science and programming, but the student in middle school may not know what python is, and in elementary school there are a lot of students using Block-base programming language like Scratch. Therefore, how to help middle school students to switch from Scratch to Python can be a good point in our project.

translate the block-based code to python code. E.g. make the python code as a password of a treasure box in the game and set the block code as password prompt. user can find the comparison table for block code and python code somewhere in the game.
