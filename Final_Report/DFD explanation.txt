DFD Level 0

This diagram briefly shown the data flow in the game.

• The player(student) can run the game and choose a lesson they are interested in, 
then the content of our lessons will be displayed in the in-game code editor. 
Students can follow the lesson and write some code, and they can see the game state change and the output of the code.

• Our other target user is teachers, they will basically do the same thing as a student,
they can run the game and check the content of the lesson, then decide which lesson they want to use to teach their students.
