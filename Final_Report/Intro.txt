	Our project is a flask server containing three lessons that is used to teach high school
 
students AI and machine learning in Python. Web pages will be presented on a code builder 

in the Minecraft game. In each lesson page, a monaco editor is implemented, which is a 

code editor that allows users to edit code just like a normal IDE. Students are allowed to run 

the code and see the output. When running the code, it will be sent to the flask server and 

the server will generate an output in console and then send back to the page. Also a reset 

button is provided to reset all the changes from users. Through this server, users can

control their agent robot in the game by sending commands to it. After each lesson, students will be

able to programme the robot to complete tasks by using the knowledge they just learned.

	The first lesson is to teach students classification.In this lesson, students will have 

a basic understanding about the K-nearest-neighbour algorithm which is one of the fundamental 

algorithms of classification. The goal of this lesson is to let student know the math behind the 

algorithm.

	The second lesson is designed to let students know what linear regression is and how to visualize 

their data. To complete this lesson students need to code the agent to build a chicken 

farm with proper size based on the amount of chicken. The size of the farm will be predicted by a linear 

model built in the lesson.

	The third lesson is to teach students what is a Kruskal Algorithm and use it to find the 

shortest path in a graph. Students will see how the algorithm is built step by step. At the end 

students need to control an agent to deliver cakes to the red spots, which are nodes in the graph,

 following the output of the algorithm.
