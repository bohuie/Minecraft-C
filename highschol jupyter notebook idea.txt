Using everglade we could great a Jupiter notebook (Minecraft themed) that is like homework/interactive lesson where students get to complete critical parts of Python code (we would have starter code and they would have to finish it to accomplish something). Would look really similar to the example notebook in the everglade presentation but for AI/ML. We would use python libraries for the AI and teach them those libraries. We need to confirm with Jeff that he wants the students to learn those libraries.
