You are the builder of this chicken farm, and you need to use your robot to build a proper chicken farm for the village. The farm should not be too large (villagers do not want to waste money) or too small (because it will affect the growth of the chickens). Therefore, you need to find a proper size by your self. Here are some data from other chicken farms, please use this data to predict the size of this farm and help the villagers to build it.</p></br><p>Farm size: [20, 40, 60, 80, 100, 120, 140, 40, 50, 60, 105, 48, 54, 63, 72, 103, 108, 93, 90, 68, 36, 90, 88]</p></br><p>N of Chickens: [15, 28, 50, 68, 75, 93, 130, 35, 38, 78, 81, 33, 40, 45, 75, 70, 100, 95, 60, 70, 70, 110, 52]</p></br><p>If you never learn statistics or machine learning before, you might be wondering How ???
