However, to solve the problem in this lesson, we need to find the minimum spanning tree.\r\n    A minimum spanning tree has the smallest weight compared with all other spanning trees for a graph. \r\n    'The weight of a spanning tree is the sum of weights given to each edge of the spanning tree.'\r\n    In this lesson, the weight of an edge represents the distance between two house. \r\n    There will be only (number of nodes -1) edges in a minimum spanning tree.\r\n2. How does a Kruskal's algorithm work?\r\n\r\n    i. The algorithm sorts all the edges in increasing order of their weight.\r\n\r\n    ii. Start with the smallest edge. If it can not form a cycle with the tree we have so far, then add this edge to the tree.\r\n    Otherwise we discard it.\r\n\r\n    iii.
